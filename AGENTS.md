# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Pull Request Workflow (mandatory)

`main` is protected; **never `git push` directly to `main`**. Every
change — including agent-authored ones — must land through a pull
request. Required approvals are set to **0**, so self-merging is the
expected default once the required status checks pass. Every PR
triggers the CI workflow (including doc-only ones); the `build`,
`rust`, and `rust-bridge-sync` jobs skip the heavy work on doc-only
diffs but still report a status, so branch protection resolves
without manual intervention. See
[`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md#contribution-workflow) for the
authoritative branch-protection table.

Standard agent loop on a fresh task:

```bash
git switch -c <type>/<short-slug>      # e.g. feat/coverage-upload
# ... make edits, run local quality gates (see DEVELOPMENT.md) ...
git push -u origin HEAD                # push the feature branch
gh pr create --fill                    # uses .github/pull_request_template.md
# ... wait for CI; fix anything red ...
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch   # self-merge once green
```

Operational notes:

- The PR template under `.github/pull_request_template.md` carries
  the canonical checklist. Tick the boxes you actually ran; do not
  blanket-check items you skipped.
- The `dependency-review` job runs PR-only and fails on `high`-
  severity advisories; if it fires on a transitive bump, prefer
  pinning the offending dep over disabling the gate.
- Branch-protection details (required checks, status-check names,
  linear history, etc.) live in
  [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md#contribution-workflow). Treat
  that section as the source of truth when reconciling repo
  settings.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
