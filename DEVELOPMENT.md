# Development

Toolchain, codegen, and logging workflows for contributors to the `nts`
package. API consumers do not need any of this — `flutter pub add nts`
plus the [Getting Started](README.md#getting-started) snippet is the
full integration path. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
layering this document operates on.

## Working with the Rust bridge

Three tools, distinct roles.

| Tool | Purpose | When to run |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `cargo` (in `rust/`) | Manage Rust deps, run unit tests | During Rust development |
| `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` | Regenerate Dart bindings | After any change to `rust/src/api/*.rs` |
| `tool/check_bindings.dart` | Verify committed bindings match the generator | Before pushing changes that touch `rust/src/api/*.rs` |
| `hook/build.dart` (Native Assets) | Compile + bundle the dylib for Flutter | Automatically on `flutter build` |

### Regenerate bindings

```bash
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
```

Commit the regenerated `lib/src/ffi/**` and `rust/src/frb_generated.rs`.

### Verify bindings are in sync

```bash
dart run tool/check_bindings.dart
```

Mirrors CI's drift check: regenerates bindings, runs `dart format` on the
output, then `git diff --exit-code` against the watched paths. Exits non-zero
with the same error message CI emits when `lib/src/ffi/` or
`rust/src/frb_generated.rs` differ from the committed state. The pinned
codegen version is read from `pubspec.yaml` so the script and CI stay in
lockstep.

### Rust unit tests (no Flutter required)

```bash
cd rust && cargo test
```

### Smoke test the Dart bindings

```bash
flutter test
```

This runs `test/ffi_smoke_test.dart`, which exercises the generated
FRB API contract in mock mode. Live Dart→Rust→network round-trips
run from the example app (`example/`); the underlying Rust crate has
its own live integration probes gated behind `--ignored` (run with
`cargo test --ignored` in `rust/`).

## Rust log verbosity

The Rust crate is compiled in one of two configurations, selected by
the `verbose_logs` Native Assets user-define in the consuming app's
`pubspec.yaml`:

| `verbose_logs` | Cargo profile | `log-strip` feature | Visible log levels |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| `false` (default) | `--release` | active | `warn!` / `error!` only |
| `true` | debug | dropped (`--no-default-features`) | all (`trace!` upward, incl. `rustls`) |

The default produces a stripped binary: `release_max_level_warn` is
compiled in via the `log-strip` Cargo feature, eliding `info!` /
`debug!` / `trace!` call sites at compile time. On iOS / Android the
shipped binary is also obfuscated by IXGuard / DexGuard; the strip is
the load-bearing protection on **desktop and future web** targets,
where those obfuscators are not in play.

### Enabling verbose logs locally

To see `rustls` handshake traces and the crate's own `info!` / `debug!`
events on iOS Console.app (subsystem `com.nts.example`) or
Android `logcat`, edit the example app's pubspec and rebuild:

```yaml
# example/pubspec.yaml
hooks:
  user_defines:
    nts:
      verbose_logs: true   # <- flip this
```

```bash
cd example
flutter clean              # drop the Native Assets hook cache
flutter run                # rebuilds rust/ without --release and
                           # without log-strip default features
```

Restore `verbose_logs: false` before committing or shipping. The
default-off posture means any pipeline that does not explicitly opt
in (CI, app-store builds, downstream embedders) still gets the
stripped release binary.

`hook/build.dart` is the authoritative wiring; the toggle is
deliberately a manual pubspec edit rather than a separate Flutter
flavor so the production-vs-developer split is visible at the call
site.
