// Hand-written public error contract for `package:nts`.
//
// Pairs with `lib/src/api/models.dart` to form the package's stable
// public surface. The wrapper functions in `lib/src/api/nts.dart`
// catch the FRB-generated `NtsError` and convert it to one of the
// variants defined here so consumer code never imports anything from
// `lib/src/ffi/`.
//
// Design notes:
// - `NtsError` is a Dart 3 `sealed class`, not a `freezed` class, so
//   exhaustive `switch (err) { ... }` in consumers does not require
//   `freezed_annotation` on the consumer side.
// - Variants whose precondition is "the TLS handshake had at least
//   reached config-build time" carry an optional `trustBackend`
//   field with the per-handshake trust-anchor backend resolved by
//   the Rust-side handshake (and on Android upgraded to
//   `TrustBackend.platformWithHybridFallback` if the hybrid
//   verifier's per-instance fallback counter incremented during the
//   handshake). New in 3.0.0; unaffected variants
//   (`invalidSpec`, `trustBackendUnavailable`, `internal`) carry
//   no `trustBackend` field.
// - Every variant with a non-`trustBackend` payload uses a
//   named-parameter constructor (`NtsError.keProtocol(message: ...,
//   trustBackend: ...)`, `NtsError.invalidSpec(message: ...)`,
//   etc.). The five `trustBackend`-carrying variants made the
//   move in 3.0.0; the three remaining single-payload variants
//   (`invalidSpec`, `trustBackendUnavailable`, `internal`) made the
//   move in 4.0.0 for surface uniformity. The pre-3.x back-compat
//   surface — the `field0` getter aliases and the underscore-
//   prefixed typedef aliases (`NtsError_InvalidSpec`, ...) — was
//   removed in 6.0.0 after three major-version lines of deprecation.
